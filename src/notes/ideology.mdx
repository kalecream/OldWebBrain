I fall under Mutualism and Anarcho-primitivism. Mutualism is the erection of cooperative markets and other economic structures without a centralized state. Where I deviate from this is believing that workers should collectively own and manage means, resources and distribution based on work contributed and any leftover profits should be directed to social welfare purposes. I have a strong investment in mutual aid projects and community decision-making. Anarcho-primitivism calls for a return to non-civilized ways of life i.e. without technology or the inequalities of social hierarchies. I think the return to non-civilized portion of ideology is misguided and impractical; inequalities would still exist if modern civilization went back to hunter-gatherer communities & it would be near impossible to enforce a return on such a large scale. We do not have to completely destroy our progress as humans to achieve an egalitarian society. We can however agree that the advance of technology has alienated Man from Nature, from each other and hastened the degradation of the environment. Some blame is to be lain on the methods of education within society, but at present day in the age of information, we have access to learning any and almost everything and the most popular ways of exchanging information are used to numb one's self like a drug, further consumerism and mass over-consumption along with harming others through fraud and mental distress and systematic misinformation campaigns. I envision a decentralised civilization with node-like communities who prioritize a responsible relationship with nature.
