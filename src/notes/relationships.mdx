# Relationships

<q>
  A relationship is a commitment
  <wbr /> to doing the work of
  <wbr /> becoming a more thoughtful person.
</q>

The most daunting problem I’ve found in trying to understand how other persons view relationships is the
seemingly scarce resources on growing and repairing relationships. Most that I've found on the internet and
literature are focused on romantic relationships when familial ties and camaraderie are the basis of most of
the relationships in our lives. This is also where I've found the most conflict, and I believe you need to
build a base of being a good human, relative and/or friend to have "successful" romantic relationships.

Another issue is having thought about it at all. There are no definitions or personal boundaries. When I've
asked persons about their thoughts on some of the things I've been trying to find my own personal definitions
for, I realize we've all been basing our social life on vibes, pop culture and hording whatever we lacked in
our formative years. The alternative I've seen isn't better. Some who have thought about it have just
swallowed some philosopher’s world-view. I have no heroes and though I want to create my own thoughts on this with my
own reasoning; I don't want to do that from scratch. It would make no sense to throw away the thoughts that
came before me in this venture. My thoughts are speaking on all relationships unless I specify romantic. I
believe that romantic relationships should be an evolution of friendship. One cannot be a good partner without
being a good friend to their partner.

These pages are an ongoing project as I navigate my relationship with myself and others. It was started and
(the bulk of it) written in 2023 to aid me in recovering from a break-up with a long-term partner. After the
realizations that came with the dissolution of that relationship, I felt the need to define how I wanted to
interact with others. I also thought about how I wanted to go about interacting with myself.

I've outlined a bunch of things for future me to check in with herself and keep us grounded without being a
yam-head or the abusive farmer. The most important thing to note is that:

          <ol className="prose">
          <li> Relationships are unique and do not follow the same path.</li>
          <li>
            Adaptability, Consideration and Grace will be neccesary for when Life likes to just throw us off our paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Communication is a must. Don't leave the other person's understanding to chance. Make sure they know where
            you are coming from and why it is so.
          </li>
          <li>Vulnerability should be encouraged.</li>
          <li>All relationships, including the one with self, require effort and intention to nurture them.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />

The most important part of a relationship for me is Consideration. I hope to make myself proud by sticking to
my values of being considerate and taking a stand, where necessary, to reduce harm in my circle of loved ones,
then my wider community. It is very important to consider how actions taken will affect someone. I want to
take time to consider my actions to:

            <ol className="prose">
          <li>Reduce the chance of causing harm</li>
          <li>Never intentionally causing harm</li>
          <li>Consider myself to not lose a sense of self becoming codependent</li>
        </ol>
