# Safety Info
- Always be aware of your blade position, and cut away from yourself when possible.  
- Beware of raw cores in thick leather.  
- Use a cork-backed metal ruler, do not rely on wood rulers for cutting.  
- New or sharpened blade EVERY time you start a new project.  
- Wear shoes around blades.  
- Don't strike metal punches, chisels, etc. with metal hammers. A mushroomed head can send shrapnel flying.
