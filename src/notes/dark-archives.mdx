## 5. Secrets of the Sages-Femmes

++Even in this time before the birth of clinical medicine, physicians in France had motivations both economic and social for separating themselves from healers without university degrees. Midwives were particularly easy targets. Few had the medical training and royal patrons of Louise Bourgeois. Instead of being referred to as sages-femmes—as the midwives called themselves—they were often dubbed vielles (old women), a coded reference to the elderly former prostitutes and madams in the provinces who used their experience with female anatomy to assist in delivering babies. Some physicians, such as André du Breil of the University of Paris, even went so far as to write that most midwives were witches.++

++“I agree that librarians have a responsibility toward preservation,” Needham responded. But “libraries have violated this incessantly in terrible ways, so it’s a little hard to stand firmly on the pedestal if you’re only applying it in the case of one binding at Harvard, when you’ve destroyed or thrown away tens of thousands of items of historical interest,” he countered. “Here it’s not a question of destroying the entire object; it’s not the binding in that sense, it’s the covering on the binding.”++

++We know far more about Henry Wellcome, the nineteenth-century pharmaceutical magnate who bought a pocketbook with the label “The cover of this book is made of Tanned Skin from the Negro whose Execution caused the War of Independence.”++

++The idea that someone would try to trick collectors and museums about the true nature of an object fills me with a mix of fear, fascination, and disgust.++
