# Quinoa

Pronounced KEEN-wah.



A grain-like seed native to South America. Slightly nutty flavour.

"A cup of cooked quinoa contains 222 calories, 39 grams of carbs, 8 grams of protein, and 4 grams of fat and delivers 58 percent of the RDA (recommended daily allowance) of manganese, 30 percent of the magnesium, 28 percent of the phosphorus, 19 percent of the folate, 18 percent of the copper, 15 percent of the iron, and 13 percent of the zinc."

1 cup of quinoa takes 2 cups of water to yield 3 cups of cooked quinoa which is supposed to serves 4-6. A 1-2 serving takes 1/4 cup. The most common quinoa, white, takes 15 mins to cook. Red takes 18 minutes, Black takes 20 minutes.

# Recipes

## Stovetop Quinoa

### Ingredients

1 cup dry quinoa
2 cups water or stock
½ teaspoon salt

### Method

Step 1: Measure Measure the dry quinoa into a fine-mesh sieve.

Step 2: Rinse Put the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse it with cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the quinoa.

Step 3: Cook In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the liquid to a boil. Add the salt and the quinoa to the water. Give the mixture a stir and bring it back to a boil. Turn the heat to low, and cover the pan. Simmer the quinoa for 15 minutes.

Step 4: Check After 15 minutes, check the quinoa for doneness. The grains should be translucent, and a little white tail should spiral out from each. To ensure fluffy quinoa, check that the grains aren’t stuck together. They should be slightly firm (but not crunchy), because the quinoa continues cooking and softening for a few minutes after being removed from the heat.
Red and black quinoa generally require a few minutes more to cook than white quinoa (see the Cooking Times chart, here). Whatever the color, if the quinoa isn’t done at 15 minutes, cover the pan, cook a minute longer, and test again.

Step 5: Rest When the quinoa is ready, remove it from the heat and check to see if any excess liquid remains in the pan. If so, drain the quinoa through a fine-mesh sieve and return it to the pan. Cover the pan with a clean dish towel (to keep condensation from dripping back into the pan), cover with the lid, and let the quinoa stand for 5 to 10 minutes.

Step 6: Fluff Like couscous, cooked quinoa should be fluffed just before going into a recipe or onto the table. Uncover the pan and use a fork to fluff and separate the grains. When done, the quinoa should look light and delicate.

## Sprouted Quinoa

1 cup dry quinoa

Thoroughly rinse the dry quinoa. Soak it in tepid water for 30 minutes, drain it through a sieve, and put it in a quart jar.
Cover the jar with a sprouting lid or perforate the jar’s regular lid 8 to 10 times (you can do that with a hammer and nail). Set the jar upside down over a bowl, taking care not to block the holes in the lid.
Every 6 hours or so, rinse the quinoa by filling the jar with water and draining it through the lid. Put the jar back in the bowl. In just a day or two, the quinoa will sprout—you’ll see its spiral tail curling from the grains. Give the sprouts a final rinse.
Leave the sprouts in the jar over the bowl, and let the water evaporate completely. You may need to stand the jar upright to finish the process. Do not allow the sprouts to dry out.
Use them immediately, or put them in a sealed zip-top bag or glass container and store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
