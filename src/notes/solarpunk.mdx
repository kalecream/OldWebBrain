# Solarpunk

- Solar : of the sun
- Punk : A leftist movement that opposes right-wing authoritarianism and capitalism with ties to anarchism.

"So what does that make Solarpunk? A movement that’s completely into the anti-authoritarian, anti-consumerist, egalitarian ideals of punk while having a heavy emphasis on nature, clean energy, and foregoing modern comforts to live sustainably. There are also people who suggest that Solarpunk has some influence from the great social theorist Murray Bookchin, a libertarian socialist who generated the concept of communalism and the theory of social ecology (Which I may go into later, I’m not sure yet). While Bookchin is a great influence and his theories/political ideologies align with Solarpunk, it would be unfair to only give Bookchin credit, Karl Marx had a part in shaping Bookchin’s idea of social ecology."
