          My website theme is based on the folklore around the{" "}
          <Link href={"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Soucouyant"}>Ole Higue</Link>. She is like the Caribbean's version of
          a Vampire, and a Werewolf combined with West African witch mythos. She's typically presented as an old woman.
          As a Yung Higue, I want our folktales to continue to evolve rather than being frozen in time.

          Would you like to see some webrings I joined? A webring is a collection of websites linked together in a
          circular structure. Each site has a "next" and "previous" link that allows us to navigate through the ring. As
          search engines continue to degrade, topic-based webrings could provide us with sources of truth.
