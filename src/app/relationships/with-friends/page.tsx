      <h1>With Friends</h1>
      <p className="prose">
        I would also consider my friends my life partners. I'm now not sure where the delineation of a romantic partner
        would start from my definition of a friend. I could start with defining a friend first and stating a romantic
        partner as a friend with greater expectations set on them.

        Dictionary Definitions of Friend: from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.
        A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.
        from The Century Dictionary. One who is attached to another by feelings of personal regard and preference; one
        who entertains for another sentiments which lead him to seek his company and to study to promote his welfare.
        One not hostile; one of the same nation, party, or kin; one at amity with another; an ally: opposed to _foe_ or
        _enemy._ A lover, of either sex. One who entertains for another such sentiments of esteem, respect, and
        affection that he seeks his society and welfare; a wellwisher; an intimate associate; sometimes, an attendant.

        I sought out dictionary definitions, but those were inadequate with too wide a range. Now, I seek out the
        etymology of Friendship. The sense that I am getting is that the definition of a friend is something personal.
        <br />
        The linguistic root of the word friend Old English freond "one attached to another by feelings of personal
        regard and preference," from Proto-Germanic *frijōjands "lover, friend" (source also of Old Norse frændi, Old
        Danish frynt, Old Frisian friund, Dutch vriend, Middle High German friunt, German Freund, Gothic frijonds
        "friend"), from PIE *priy-ont-, "loving," present-participle form of root
        [*pri-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pri- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *pri- ") "to love."
        <br />I found it adorable that both 'friendship' and 'free' came from root of 'Love'. However, this brings me no
        closer to my own definition for a friend. I asked my close friends for their personal definitions, but it was
        not something they had rigidly defined for themselves outside of people they care about and like to be around.

      <p className="prose">
        Friendship, by contrast, is essentially a kind of _relationship grounded in a particular kind of special concern
        each has for the other as the person she is; and whereas we must make conceptual room for the idea of unrequited
        love, ==unrequited friendship is senseless.== Consequently, accounts of friendship tend to understand it not
        merely as a case of reciprocal love of some form (together with mutual acknowledgment of this love), but as
        essentially involving significant interactions between the friends—as being in this sense a certain kind of
        relationship. [^2]

      <ol className="prose">
        <b>Healthy friendships have a balance of giving and taking:</b>
        <li>Can you remember the last time you did something thoughtful for a friend?</li>
        <li>Or they did something for you?</li>
        <li>Who normally reaches out first?</li>
        <li>If you live a distance apart, who makes the effort to travel?</li>
        <li>Who do you spend the majority of your conversations focused on?</li>
        <li>Would you call them if you were in trouble? And if you did, do you think they would be there for you?</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="prose">
        Does a friend really need to meet the above requirements? I don't think they do all the time. Maybe hit some
        periodically? It might depend on how close you have been. It would be easier for close friends who have been
        separated by time/distance to do maintenance mode friendships. I wouldn’t have friendships like that with
        someone I just met nor would I have the above expectations off the bat. I would let the other person dictate the
        expectations I should have of them.
      </p>
      <p className="prose">
        I’m noticing though that people tend to both be overfamiliar and refuse to reciprocate vulnerability. It’s like
        people want your whole story even if there is no material help, comfort or companionship happening through the
        trials or great times. I’m an open book, but it bothers me how needy, demanding and entitled new acquaintances
        can be.

        <h2>Emotional Bonds</h2>
        <p className="prose">
          I reject that close friends cannot have an emotional bond similar to that of a romantic relationship. I accept
          that the partners of my friends will likely see facets of them that I never will and vice versa, but that can
          still ring true for any of my friends with any of their other friends. That's a fact of life and not a
          partnership thing. It may be that I cannot give the time investment into that person that a partner would.
        </p>
        <h2>A Common Future</h2>
        <p className="prose">
          When I try to find an answer on where other persons draw the line of friendship vs partnership, it seems to be
          a case of sharing common future plans. It doesn't matter if a friend has a completely different life
          trajectory in mind, while a partner is expected (?) to be on a similar path. I'm not sure if I agree or
          disagree yet. It does seem like it would make things more simple if the partners are on a similar path.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          I need to explore the thought: a partner doesn't have a similar life path, but a synergistic path like someone
          who is traveling the world with a long-distance partner who really likes their space.
