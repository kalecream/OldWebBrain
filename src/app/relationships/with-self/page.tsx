        <h1>With Self</h1>
        <p className="prose">
          While this section will be focused on the Self, I believe we need strong relationships with ourselves to have a
          strong relationship with others where we can be aware of and prevent boundary lines from being crossed.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          Fostering a healthy relationship with myself is being started from scratch. My method of going through life
          was to mentally check out through media consumption and daydreams once the going got tough, and handing off
          the problem to a future me. I am now that future me. Having expressed opinions of the violence I would
          like to enact on previous versions of me, I have been told to be gentler with myself. I am now on a journey of
          paying more attention, giving greater care and being softer with her.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          When I was younger, a teenager specifically, it was a completely foreign concept to me that I would live this
          long. Thankfully, I’m still at a young enough age where I’ve come to terms that barring an accident or
          illness, I will not get my death wish. Having already experienced a debilitating illness, I'm not interested
          in experiencing anything like that again.

            Learning to meet my own needs as set out in Maslow’s Hierarchy. When I feel overwhelmed, this is the order
            on which I need to focus. I will lay out what my priorities should be in caring for myself, and I will abide
            by these priorities in times of crisis. Hopefully, I will also abide by these priorities in times of calm.

            <p>
              These needs are the most important set and ones that we regularly betray or allow us to be led astray. I
              have found when my higher order needs are not being met, these are the needs which ground me. In future, I may expand all of these to their own pages.

                <b>Water.</b> I have a measured 1.3L water bottle that shows me reccomended drink levels from 8AM to 7PM, but I still do not take in enough water daily. I tend to focus solely on what's in front of me or be wildly distracted. In either scenario, I keep forgetting to drink water.<br/>
                <b>Food.</b>
                <b>Execrete.</b> No problems here.<br/>
                <b>Shower.</b> Showering is useful for more than getting clean. It's a good way to give a mini reset to the day with a cold shower.<br/>
                <b>Sleep.</b> I have a bedtime routine that I have been following for a few months now. I have been sleeping better and waking up refreshed.<br/>
                <b>Sex.</b> Eh.

          <h2>Self-Regulation</h2>
          <h3>Meditation</h3>
          <p className="prose">
            Meditation has a history that goes back thousands of years, and many meditative techniques began in Eastern
            traditions. The term “meditation” refers to a variety of practices that focus on mind and body integration
            and are used to calm the mind and enhance overall well-being.
          </p>
          <h3>Solo Dating</h3>
          <p className="prose">
            Not to pollute the definition, but a date for me is an appointment. This is why I have solo dates, friend
            dates and romantic dates listed out as separate things. Historically, solo dates make me more excited than
            romantic dates, but less than friend dates. I also put more effort into solo dates as I'm less likely to
            flake on myself than someone is on me as well, as the whole purpose is to go out and feel good. This is
            different from just “going out” somewhere, which can be done at any time. The entire purpose is the
            intention of wooing myself behind it.
          </p>
          <h3>Self Improvement</h3>
          <p className="prose">
            Regular self-improvement is found under actualisation. This self-improvement is based on how I relate to
            other persons.
          </p>
          <h4>Toxic Traits</h4>
          <h5>Love bombing?</h5>
          <p className="prose">
            I realise that a lot of us confuse limerance for love-bombing. For example, I used to say to my friends that
            I want a love-bombing situationship. No one wants that. I've always tried to give myself fully to be the
            person in relationships that someone can rely on. After learning about love-bombing, I wondered if I was a
            love-bomber, then after learning the definition of love-bombing, I don't feel like I qualify as a
            love-bomber. I don't intentionally withdraw affection. When I'm pissed off, I need space. I've always felt
            guilty about that. That's mainly because I have never, not once, had that space respected when it should
            have been. This leads to being ignored and that is withdrawn affection. I need to be communicative and to
            foster a partner's complete social circle to be their lighthouse instead of just me being a flashlight in
            the dark.
            <br />
            <br />
            Love Bombing is a manipulative and intense behavior often observed in the early stages of a relationship,
            characterized by the excessive and overwhelming expression of affection, attention, and positive
            reinforcement by one person towards another. The love bomber employs extravagant gestures, constant
            communication, and declarations of deep emotional attachment with the intention of creating a heightened
            sense of euphoria and dependency in the recipient. While on the surface, it may appear as genuine affection,
            love bombing is often a tactic employed by individuals with ulterior motives, such as establishing control,
            masking negative qualities, or manipulating the other person emotionally. It can lead to an imbalanced power
            dynamic and, in some cases, be indicative of toxic relationship patterns.

          <h5>Unsolicited Advice</h5>
          <p className="prose">
            In the past I have given unsolicited advice instead of being a sounding board. Sometimes a person just need
            someone to repeat that "this really sucks!" with me instead of trying to hand them half-baked generic
            solutions that they are already aware of and may not work for their context.
          </p>
          <h5>Devil's Advocacy</h5>
          <p className="prose">This used to be a feature of conversation that I thankfully think I've turned off.</p>
          <h5>Being Flaky</h5>
          <p className="prose">
            How do I still have friends? I'm so thankful for my heartbeats. I didn't make time for community. I used to
            throw money at the problem instead. When I had nothing my community still supported me through it.
