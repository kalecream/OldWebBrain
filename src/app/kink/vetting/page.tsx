        <h1>Vetting Playmates</h1>
        <p className="prose blur">
          It's also hard to know what to look for in play partners when lacking experience. Vetting a potential playmate
          or play partner is an important first step before play. Regardless of where we fall on the spectrum of BDSM
          practitioners, there are general points to follow.
        </p>
        <h2>Knowing Your Limits</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          What's the rush in finding a play partner? We need to actually know our limits before we can communicate them.
          Let's take the time to explore our own desires and limits with solo play before involving someone else to figure
          it out together.
        </p>
        <h2>References</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          This is a small community; unless they are also a beginner, someone has likely played with them and can tell you
          whether they are safe and uphold boundaries and good values.
        </p>
        <h2>Equality</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          Unless we've paid for a professional session (and indicated we are comfortable with that), the playmate should not
          approach you already playing a role. Whether you're a sub being intimidated by a strange Dom or a Dom being forced
          into a top role against your will, this is a glaring sign that the person lacks boundaries and will not respect
          consent. Your playmate needs to approach you as equals to set the terms of play.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Human Compatibility</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          We need to get to know this playmate personally and emotionally. We need chemistry. This is not just about
          physical attraction but also about how we communicate and how we feel about each other. If you're not comfortable
          with the person, you're not going to be comfortable with the play.
        </p>
        <h2>Kink Compatibility</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          What are their risk profiles, and how do they view our risk profile? How do they maintain friendships or connections
          with other play partners? If someone falls out with every other person they meet or simply uses them as a kink
          dispenser, this is an early sign of incompatibility.
        </p>
        <h2>Negotiation</h2>
        <p className="prose blur">
          After figuring out kink compatibility, it's time to define the boundaries of play. We should discuss safewords
          versus established systems like the traffic light system.
          <br /><br /> Some resources I've read suggest talking about different BDSM models (SSC, RACK, PRICK). As a beginner,
          I'm personally recommending that you stick to Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC) until you're more experienced or
          guided by an experienced play partner. Risk Aware Consensual Kink (RACK) and Personal Responsibility Informed
          Consensual Kink (PRICK) are more advanced models that you absolutely should not use until you have awareness of
          your limits.
          <br />  <br />
          Here, we also want to talk about aftercare. Aftercare is the time after play when we check in with each other
          and offer reassurance. It's important to discuss what aftercare looks like for both parties.
