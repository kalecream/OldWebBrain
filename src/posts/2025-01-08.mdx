For 2025 I have quite a bit of hopes, fears, plans, and unlearning to tackle. I don't know what the next 350+ days will bring, but I'm mentally prepared to take them on one by one. We've made it to the other side of the first half of the 2020s. I can do this one too. 

What do I want out of the first quarter of the year? A foundation. The past season has been catching-up to what I should have been doing and was shirking. This is now the time to have something to build on. 

I've been exploring my hobbies some more with a litter of unfinished projects and unstarted interests. This year, I'm limiting myself to only continuing projects that I've already started or have made extensive plans to start. I want to take up leatherworking, fireflow and cordwaining (shoe-making). I also want to develop my present skills like power carving, sewing, shibari, sculpting and painting. I want more creative outlets, but I also want them to be useful to me. I have separate therapeutic sessions for aimless practice, but I like when my efforts are towards a material end. 

I want to be my own muse. This is already the case, but I want to refine some parts of myself to fit my vision. I worry about falling prey to trending aesthetics. I also worry about how much focus I have given to minor personal issues in the face of looming personal and global threats. 

Let's take a segue. I am worried about bird flu; not just on illness itself, but the impact that this would have on food supplies. I am worried about how the world has moved on from Palestine - lost as another item in a news ticker and actively suppressed by social media networks despite the small amount of information coming out of the region these days. I am worried about social media. It feels like social media as we know it is dying. There is a need to be brand friendly and palatable for Meta, and a need to disrupt information pathways from Elon Musk. I encourage persons to own and operate their own personal websites. It gives you a place to be completely free. Visitors to my website can take me or leave me exactly as I am. 

We have some rough times ahead of us, “thinking positively” or sticking our heads in the sand is not what we'll save us. Actually, let me not claim that I know what will save us. What will give us the best chance is using our mickle to mek a muckle. Let us also learn from the mistakes made in the COVID-19 early years.
