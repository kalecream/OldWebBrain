You do not need a new year to change your course! If your year did not start as planned, that's ok! New Years does not have to be January 1st. You can make your New Year into your birthday, a random Friday or some other day that holds significance for you.

Last year around this time, I correctly identified that things were not going my way. I thought what I needed was more discipline. While that would have helped, what I really needed was to learn how to have better recoveries. When we plan, we make success the only option. We need to have our steps pre-planned for how to re-route ourselves to success if a plan fails.

I have that in place now, I think, but the only way to know things for sure is through hindsight. I hope December me will be proud of what we accomplished this year. I am giving up a lot to make it the best one yet. I'm ready for the stumbles, falls, resets and to hit continue.
