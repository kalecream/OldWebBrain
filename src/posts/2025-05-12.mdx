Man, I haven't touched any of my hobbies in months. I've been wanting to continue work on my site so I've given
myself 20 minutes to give an update:

- The fermentation for the Vinegaroon is so richly dark red now that I can't believe I tried dying the leather while it
was still translucent.
- I'll start on trying to make my own Ginger bug again this week. The last time I was tried was a failed
attempt in Feb 2024 that tasted quite off.
- I'm planting some Marigolds and Callaloo today in my seed starter.
- I started journaling in a physical book again recently. That feels so good


I wanted to share this passage from Wild Fermentation by Sandor Katz:

> The word fermentation has another connotation. Ideas ferment, as they spread and mutate and inspire movements for
change. In the American Heritage dictionary the secondary meaning of fermentation is “unrest, agitation.” I feel equally committed to this aspect of fermentation. As an agent for change, I am a cultural manipulator, proud to be subversive.
> As you watch your fermenting food bubble away as bacteria and yeast work their transformative magic, envision
yourself as an agent for change, creating agitation and unrest, releasing bubbles of transformation into the social order. Use your fermented goodies to nourish your family and friends and allies. The life-affirming power of these basic foods contrasts sharply with the lifeless industrially processed foods that fill supermarket shelves.
