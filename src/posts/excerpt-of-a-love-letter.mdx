Thinking if I'm “ready” to say this sent me scrambling back to the comfort of literature, thinking <i>the pre-established words can help!</i> But they are neither my words nor my feelings. I do not want to present to you a brittle facsimile of someone else's fully-formed enduring love for another. <i>What did I do before?</i> I dont remember. That was not me, as I am now, and they were not us, as we are. <i>Am I moving too fast?</i> What is too fast? And who decided the parameters for us? We have no milestones to meet. There is no progress bar over our heads with checkpoints for what a good time together looks like or should be. I find you magnetic. Making you feel good currently makes me feel great. I will continue to do so until that is not the case. I want to make sure that I'm careful in agreeing to only what I can sustain. I don't view my feelings as embarrassing. If you need me to, for dramatic sake, I'll gladly shout them from the nearest hill overlooking the plains of Kingston. What I say and what I do is given freely without obligation because it brings us joy. It feels right, it feels safe, it feels easy to choose to do with you.

I frequently tell my friends I love them. There are many who I love because they deserve to have some love reserved for them just for existing. To work towards the ability of loving someone in the fiery and deeply rooted consummate way, I first need to be able to tell my lover that I love them platonically. Friendship should be the core of any romance, as our friends are our life-partners too. I think people would be less lonely if they realized this instead of pinning their hopes on one person or an endless conveyor belt of temporary people. The devotion I have for my friends is one I have already extended to you. I have quickly made you one of my loved ones and confidantes.

You are my sunshine; I bask in the love you have for me, flourish in the love you have for me. I love you in a way that radiates out to everyone else in my life. Like I suddenly have more love to give because I have begun loving you too.  

I know what love is supposed to be. It is not just a feeling. It is a choice. Feelings will come and go, while chosen kindnesses will remain. I put forward my love to you with no temporal promises, but the present moment. I am being mindful of not overstepping to give words which are easily broken. My time blindness alone yields me enough broken promises to not take on any more and I would like my words to carry weight. Given that our human lives themselves are ephemeral, the amount of time I have received to love you is not known to us. Whether our allotted time together is just today or for the rest of my days, I promise the same things to you: the whole truth, endless affection and consideration with a commitment to helping you love yourself and spread more love to others.

You are such a welcomed distraction. I'm less of a stranger now, but still receiving a crash course in who you are. During this, I've taken great care to consider whether it's you or the idea of you which appeals to me. I’ve mulled over my thoughts to find if what I am feeling is real, imagined or simply magnified through the frequency of our interactions. Beyond the first few moments, it has been the same answer. So if asked, <i>when did I know?</i> I can now say:
