Normally, tostones are made using green plantains. My green plantains ended up ripening on me because I was having a busy week. What I originally planned was making tostones in the waffle-maker to go with some ripe mango and mint. My mint plant has since died. 

I didn't want just soft ripe plantain because I was in the mood for something crunchy. Then, I thought about another recipe that I wanted to make, but didn't have all the ingredients for ✨ fritters ✨. Dipping the plantains in the fritters batter after the first fry and putting the plantains in the tostonera would make them crunchy for the second fry and give me a soft and filling center. It tasted like a thick potato chip. _I may come back to add recipes and such later_. Here's how it turned out:
