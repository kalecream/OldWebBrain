Returning to my early Spring self. Back then, I spent my days mainly offline focusing on tasks in front of me or upskilling purely for joy. I ran a lot more often. I felt regulated. I didn't have much and was always stressed, but there was a sense of contentment. There's no contentment in the Fall. The Summer toil was to no end The hope Spring held in its hands has fled. We're left looking ahead to a bitter Winter.

This is only a dream. It makes no sense to erase portions of the past, even if we could. Like Icarus, we can't control the fall after we've burnt ourselves playing in the warmth of the sun, ignoring ever-present danger. Yet, even broken, we can re-build ourselves. We can shake off thoughts of isolation and self-pity to fly to newer heights once again.

A major challenge I have is staying present: present in conversation, present within myself, resisting the urge to slip into autopilot or daydreaming in the middle of conversations. My seeming inability to stay present has resulted in issues relating to discipline. Discipline is the major theme of what I'm exploring in this season and it has led me to some unexpected places in the past few weeks.The journey has been an unsatisfying and rocky one, and I anticipate it will be a lifelong endeavor. I have always said that all my growth has been against my will and the good traits are consciously enforced.

I’ve been finding small steps that help me ground myself in the present and therefore I'm doing a better job of remembering now that I write in my bullet journal all day. It’s like having an anchor: somewhere to jot down thoughts, draw, paint, and process my feelings and tasks. Having something physical—something that doesn’t need to be charged—keeps me in the moment.  Now, I'm not brand new to the fact that books exist, but something feels different this time. Maybe it’s the deliberate way I’m using it or the newfound appreciation for slowing down. Whatever it is, I’m grateful for the sense of presence and stability it brings.
