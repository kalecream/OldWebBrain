My leathercrafting kit is here! and some airlocks! I'm so excited to make my ginger beer soon. The first things I'm making with the leather will be two choker collar designs; a nature/higue theme and an ocean theme.  

I found an active leathercrafting forum ([leatherworker.net](https://leatherworker.net/forum)) and looked up some more resources to DIY instead of buying. Luckily, I found a quality metal belt buckle in my hardware stash. The only thing that worries me now going into  my first design is my chosen pendant having brass housing instead of silver-like (like the rest of the hardware), and whether I'm limited in being able to add metal embossing based on the size of the buckle. 

I'm going to try patterning out in cardboard first with a modified version of the collar template I found on [Github](https://github.com/vanillaleathercraft/leather) by @vanillaleathercraft, This will also give me time for my DIY leather dye to form! I need the leather dye to make the edges look "proper" since I also cheaped out on buying Tokonole. My DIY leather dye is Vinegaroon which can easily be made at home by dissolving steel wool in a jar of vinegar, then counteracted with some baking soda. Sorry, I do not have any measurements for any of this. Let's just be guided by the spirit of somebody's ancestors.

My other hobbies deserve some more love, but I have been feeling so sluggish and stagnant this week. I'm hoping that will pass after this weekend. it is exciting to be so excited about something again and if I get my way, I'll get my buugeng in February to start my flow practice. I'll be one step closer to fireflow! Let me not get ahead of myself. One step at a time.
 
I figured out some resolutions and made my January 2025 Bingo Card from the generator at [BingoBaker.com](https://bingobaker.com) earlier this week. Proud to say that I have already knocked some items off the list. I think my life is finally coming together again.
