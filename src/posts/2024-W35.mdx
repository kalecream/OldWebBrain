I'm surprised that I've kept up logging consistently every Saturday for a month. I've been in a slump still, so no real progress. I've been reading a great poem. It's called the [A Litany to Survival by Audre Loude](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/147275/a-litany-for-survival). It's about the continued survival of marginalised communities under oppression and despite being about completely different things it gives me the internal feels that [Do not go gentle into that good night by Dylan Thomas](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night) gives me.

<q>For those of us who live at the shoreline<br/>
standing upon the constant edges of decision<br/>
crucial and alone</q>

Years ago, I used to keep a notebook where I wrote all my favourite lines from poems and movies. I might do it again. A physical notebook with colourful quotes jammed in every direction. The quote that melted me the most this week came from an unexpected source. I was watching Free Guy (2021). This was a  movie I expected to be terrible, but turned out entertaining towards the end. In it, someone is breaking up with a virtual character when he tells her that he loves her and even if it's just in his coding, someone wrote that code. He tells her he is a love letter to her. This really struck me.
