I have been reading a great poem. it is called the ["A Litany to Survival" by Audre Lorde](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/147275/a-litany-for-survival). it is about the continued survival of marginalised communities under oppression and despite being about completely different things it gives me the internal chill that ["Do not go gentle into that good night" by Dylan Thomas](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night).

<q>For those of us who live at the shoreline<br/>
standing upon the constant edges of decision<br/>
crucial and alone</q>

Years ago, I used to keep a notebook where I wrote all my favourite lines from poems and movies. I might do it again. A physical notebook with colourful quotes jammed in every direction. 

The quote that melted me the most this week came from an unexpected source. I was watching Free Guy (2021), a movie I expected to be terrible, but turned out entertaining in the second half. The context is someone breaking up with an NPC in a video game.

<q>I love you, Millie<br/>Maybe that is my programming
talking, but guess what?<br/> Someone wrote that program.<br/> I'm just a love letter to you.<br/> Somewhere out there
is the author.</q>
