I love New Years. I'm pretty sure I could find a New Year in every month so that's my new main 2025 Goal. Happy Lunar New Year! The New Moon is a time where I re-discover how dark it is to travel with no moon in the night sky. 

This New Moon marks a transition from Winter to Spring. For Northern Hemispherers, we will have to wait until March for the official changing of the seasons. For me, who never had winter, it is dry season.

2025 is the Chinese year of the Snake, and as a Pig it will be a rare  unlucky year for us. I discovered this when I looked up my horoscope as a placebo to get some motivation for 2025. Everything told me "this will not be your best year, hold your head down and be cautious", so that's what I have been doing since the calendar year started. I have gotten many more things done than I normally would however I still was not able to get a Bingo on my January goals. I think it was a valiant attempt considering I chose to do a 7x7 card.
