### General

The following are really my notes because I don't have good memory and I like being able to copy paste commands for the ones I won't use often. So this is really a mini-wiki, but I figure it will be useful for persons who want to contribute, learn code or copy and change things to customise the site to their liking.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# View the website at:  http://localhost:3001
yarn dev
```

### Prisma

```bash
# Install the Prisma CLI
yarn add --dev prisma

# Generate artifacts
npx prisma generate

# Create tables
npx prisma db push

# Migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# See the tables
npx prisma studio

```

</center>

> [!NOTE]
> If you have problems with environment variable not being found, make sure the .env file is just .env and not .env.local with the prisma information.

```bash
# Update database after schema change
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name "migration-name"

npx prisma migrate dev
```

> [!WARNING]
> Your tables will be dropped and you will lose data unless you edit the migration file to renaming instead of dropping. It's a simple SQL query. Here is an [SQL Cheatsheet](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-cheat-sheet/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you intend on deploying to Vercel, it is very important that you click this link should you encounter a build error -> [Link](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/help-articles/vercel-caching-issue)
