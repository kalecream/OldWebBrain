			'In every age, people are certain that only the things they have deemed valuable have true value. The search for love and the search for wealth are always the two best stories. But while a love story is timeless, the story of a quest for wealth, given enough time, will always seem like the vain pursuit of a mirage.',
			'The Roman army required salt for its soldiers and for its horses and livestock. At times soldiers were even paid in salt, which was the origin of the word salary and the expression “worth his salt” or “earning his salt.” In fact, the Latin word sal became the French word solde, meaning pay, which is the origin of the word, soldier.',
			'Salt is so common, so easy to obtain, and so inexpensive that we have forgotten that from the beginning of civilization until about 100 years ago, salt was one of the most sought-after commodities in human history.',
			'It takes two years for the salt to reach the center of a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.',
			'When these early settlers hunted, they would leave red herring along their trail because the strong smell would confuse wolves, which is the origin of the expression red herring, meaning “a false trail.',
			'Pastrami, of Romanian origin, is dried, spiced, and salted beef, smoked over hardwood sawdust and then steamed. The name may come from pastra, the Romanian verb “to preserve.',
			'In the first century A.D., Pliny estimated that the average Roman citizen consumed only 25 grams of salt a day. The modern American consumes even less if the salt content of packaged food is not included.',

		review:
			"Satire is cringe. The portrayal of individualism was a bit overwhelming. I think it's important to have a balance between individualism and collectivism. While reading this book, it prompted me to reflect on instances where I may have inadvertently prioritized my own individualism at the expense of others. I think it's important to be aware of this and to be mindful of the impact of our actions on others. I believe it is a dangerous mindset to think that we owe nothing to our fellow humans.",

		quotes: [
			'The fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.',
			"Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony. 'Accursed creator{ !} Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and abhorred.",
			'Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.',
			'Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? But I was doomed to live.',
			'I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.',
			'Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be his world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow',

			'As you watch your fermenting food bubble away as bacteria and yeast work their transformative magic, envision yourself as an agent for change, creating agitation and unrest, releasing bubbles of transformation into the social order. Use your fermented goodies to nourish your family and friends and allies. The life-affirming power of these basic foods contrasts sharply with the lifeless industrially-processed foods that fill supermarket shelves.',
			'The word fermentation has another connotation. Ideas ferment, as they spread and mutate and inspire movements for change. In the American Heritage dictionary the secondary meaning of fermentation is “unrest, agitation.” I feel equally committed to this aspect of fermentation. As an agent for change, I am a culturural manipulator, proud to be subversive.'
