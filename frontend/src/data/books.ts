		review:
			"Satire is cringe. The portrayal of individualism was a bit overwhelming. I think it's important to have a balance between individualism and collectivism. While reading this book, it prompted me to reflect on instances where I may have inadvertently prioritized my own individualism at the expense of others. I think it's important to be aware of this and to be mindful of the impact of our actions on others. I believe it is a dangerous mindset to think that we owe nothing to our fellow humans.",

			'My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.',
			'Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish . I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars.',
			'We wish to be damned with you, rather than blessed with all our brothers.',
			'I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man’s soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet.',
			'Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger in solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that there is joy as a bond between us. ’ ',
			'I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honour is a thing to be earned.'

		review: 'Mother of Science Fiction indeed. I LOVED this book. It was so much more than I expected from the pop culture depictions of Frankenstein{\'}s monster. It was a beautiful, tragic, and thought-provoking story about grief and what it means to be human.. I highly recommend it.',
		quotes: [
			'The fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.',
			'Hateful day when I received life!{\'} I exclaimed in agony. {\'}Accursed creator{ \!} Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and abhorred.',
			'Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.',
			'Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? But I was doomed to live.',
			'I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.',
			'Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be his world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow'
