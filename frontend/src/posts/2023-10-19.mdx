I do not want this to have the same format as blog posts. This will be changed to something less ugly. I also do not like my current format of blog posts, but I'll be figuring out the log format before I tackle the blog styling and utilities.

```txt playlist.txt

# Music
All The Ways // Wet
Crazy // Gnarls Barkley

# Podcast
Philosophize This (podcast)

```
