## Physical 
- I restarted Couch to 5K. I did not complete the first week. Breathing was a little difficult on Day 2, but a start is a start. 
- Experimented with Udon and Chickpeas. Independently and Together. Mambo sauce is the universe's gift to me.

## Mental
- Running has helped my emotional self-regulation. It completely reduces my feelings of anxiety. Still, I'm in a period of having to change activities every 10 minutes to keep myself productive and focused.
- Studied with a friend to review some of the lessons to study for the Jamaican Sign Language  mid-course exam.
- Watched "Badboys 3" with a friend, but fell asleep during the movie because I was very tired. It wasn't my type of movie, but the scene transitions were awesome.
- Read "Executing Magic in the Modern Era: Criminal Bodies and the Gallows in Popular Medicine"

## Organisation 
- Started re-organizing my closet and altering my clothes. Embroidery is much harder than I remember. 

## Recreational 
- Started a rock carving from a stone I picked up at the beach earlier ths year.
- Listened to audiodramas: "Afflicted" and "Light House". I loved Afflicted being a hoodoo zombie thriller. Light House took me a little while to get into, but turned out to be a great listen that hooked me until the end.

## Social
- Wrote a bit on the Self portion of my Guide on relationships with myself and others. I need to work on the Family section soon.
- Went out to a friend's fight night and saw another friend there! I'm expressing gratitude for friendship this week.
