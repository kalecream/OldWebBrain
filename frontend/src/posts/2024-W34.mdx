## Now

I did almost nothing of value this week! :) I felt ill for the majority of it and focused on finishing things on my plate and recovering (hence the title!)

## Sectors

### Recreation

- Watched many movies this week: Mad God (2021), A Quiet Place: Day One (2024), The Shining (1980), Cloverfield (2008), Killler Klowns from Outer Space (1988)
