## Now

I have a month and change left to make those goals happen. It's getting down to the wire and I honestly don't want to roll over some of these things into yet another quarter.

- Getting my amateur radio licence.
  - It has been a month since I first e-mailed the JARA via the e-mail on their website and reached out to a member via Twitter.
  - Read chapter 2/9 for "The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual"
- Calisthenics: Foundations
  - My normal workout would take 2 hours, so I've broken it down into 15 minutes instead focusing on my upper body strength to build my noodle arms and weak core.
- Sewing: Level 5
  - Last Saturday, I tried altering some pants with some embroidery floss and a ladder stitch. The last time I had to sew something reminded me that sewing requires some stamina, but the arm strength to ram through (faux?) deniem here was unexpected.
- Jamaican Sign Language: Level 1
  - I decided not to do the exam, but to continue with the free course and memorise the signs if I can, bookmarking the videos to do a continued refresher. What is taught at this level seems enough to hold a conversation.
- FullStackOpen
  - Lol. This is going to be rolled over for sure.
- Guide on relationships
  - I wrote a bit on my relationship with myself and taking care of needs based on their position in the Maslow's hieracrhy.
- C25K
  - I still have not finished week 1. When I did Week 1 Day 2, my breathing became difficult and it has remained a little laboured since. I WILL be finishing week 1 and 2 this coming week no matter what. (-.-)
- GBStudio Game
  - I've found a name and a logo! The name will come from the game we played: Heaven nor Hell. The game will be called "NOR." with the combined water droplet/flame replacing the O.

## Sectors

### Physical

- I've been committing to getting adequate sleep this week, which has been having the unexpected effect of making me more tired...
- I've been trying to manipulate my natural hair more. One day, I'll get the tenacity needed to twist up my hair before bed.

### Mental

- I have a solid morning and nightly routine down that melts away the stress of the day and the worries of moments aheads. Something about drawing some hot water for a bath while it is still dark out mixed with [the muffled "Swan Upon Leda"/"Shrike" from a Hozier playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rqwdl9fTvw&pp=ygULc29mdCBob3ppZXI%3D) gives me nice spine chills. I'm finding comfort in looking forward to my daily and other periodic rituals now.
- Getting up very early then having a mid-morning nap gives me more energy throughout the day than my regular running on 3 hours sleep trying to get everything done.
- JUTC (the public transport bus system) crushed me like a bug under its heel this week. I also missed a stop and wasted money, but the second thing is entirely on me. I would like to put some effort in for the coming week to figure out why despite [the recent importation of 100 buses](https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20240715/100-new-jutc-buses-added-fleet) to be added to the fleet, some routes have degraded service quality. I've found with my regular bus that there is a problem with a speaker towards the back so I can identify I'm getting the same bus every time. Is it a maintence issue? I have heard other persons at my stop complaining that they can only get one chance to catch the bus per day.

### Organisation

- Continued organising around my apartment. I'm currently organising my laundry area, random papers and occupational stuff before I go back to my closet.

### Recreational

- Continuing the rock carving. I didn't do much after I got the basic shape down. I had planned to put it on the front of the art-book. Now, I'm thinking to make it into a pendant.
- Mostly "Welcome to The Magic Tavern", "SCP Archives" and "Uncanny County" this week.

### Social

- I haven't been super social this week besides posting on social media. I'm a little tired and I don't think I will be going out until payday.
- I saw a thread on [intimacy](https://x.com/AgotaDubi/status/1824097708006633507) on Twitter that reminds me that in closeness (intimacy), we will have times of closeness and times of distance.
