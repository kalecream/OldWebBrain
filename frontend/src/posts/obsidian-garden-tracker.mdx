Gardening is a rewarding and fulfilling activity, but it can be overwhelming to keep track of all the details. Between the different types of plants, planting dates, watering schedules, and pest control measures, it's easy to lose track of what needs to be done when. That's where a garden tracker comes in handy. By tracking your garden's progress, you can stay organized and ensure that your plants thrive.

Firstly, we need to create a new note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). We'll call it [Plants.md](). This note will be the main hub for all of our garden tracking information. We'll use the [Dataview ](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to create a table of all the plants we're growing, and I used it with Minimal Theme.

Then, we need to create a new note called [New_Plant.md](). This note will be a template for all of our plants.
