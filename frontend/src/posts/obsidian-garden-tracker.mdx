Between the different types of plants, planting dates, watering schedules, and pest control measures, it's easy to lose track of what needs to be done when. That's where a garden tracker comes in handy. 



## Plant Template

Firstly, we need to create a new note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). We'll call it [Plants.md](). This note will be the main hub for all of our garden tracking information. We'll use the [Dataview ](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to create a table of all the plants we're growing, and I used it with Minimal Theme.

```md
---
cssclass: cards, cards-cover, cards-1-1
---
```

Then, we need to create a new note called `New_Plant.md`. This note will be a template for all of our plants.

```md Plants.md


category:: [[Plants]] #apartment
image:: ![img](https://placehold.it/100x100)

water::
sun::
fertilizer::
last_fertilized::
sprouted::
pH::
harvest::

```

## New Plant Button

To automatically create a new plant, we will need to use to create a plant template:

```button
name New Plant
type note(New Plant) template
action NewPlant
```

## Plant Table

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID image,
file.link,
":luc_droplet: " + water,
":luc_droplets: " + date(reverse(sort(file.inlinks))[0]) + " (" + (date(today) - date(reverse(sort(file.inlinks))[0])) + ")"  /
AS "Last watered",
":luc_sun: " + sun,
":fas_spray_can_sparkles: " + fertilizer,
":fas_spray_can: " + last_fertilized,
":fas_seedling: " + (date(today) - date(sprouted) ) + " (" + sprouted + ")",
":luc_flask_conical:" + pH,
":luc_moon: " + harvest

FROM [[Plants]] and #apartment
```
