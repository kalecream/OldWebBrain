The features I would like for my ideal personal finance tool are very simple. It needs to have features like:

1. Re-occuring transactions.
2. The ability to use multiple currencies in my transactions. I mainly use USD, JMD and some cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC.
3. Monthly Balance visualisation with a forecasting for my balance throughout the month with my expected expences to let me know if I will run out of money before the end of the month.
4. Expense Report breakdown for each category by different periods.
5. Tracking for savings and investments.
6. Customisable for my expanding financial needs. For example: I live paycheck to paycheck so I need to track my expenses and income on a weekly basis. There is also have a savings account that I want to track on a monthly basis. I also have a few investments that I want to track on a quarterly basis. Later, I will start having an interest in a retirement account or even FIRE, but that's not currently possible without a significant increase in income.

I would ultimately love to connect to an API to automate handling expenses, but one of my two local banks does not even allow me to download a CSV file so that dream is a long way off. One does allow me to get a csv that I can then feed into beancount, the other allows me to download a pdf statement (without properly formatted tables) so I need a tool to make the rest of my finance record keeping as painless as possible.

## Beancount with Fava

I started off with beancount because of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plug-in called [Ledger-obsidian](https://github.com/tgrosinger/ledger-obsidian). I could not for the life of me get that plug-in to work so I read around the internet for a bit and decided to just use the original [ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger) from the CLI as the creator intended. I found it a little counterintuitive and that led me to beancount and fava!

[Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/) is a double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial transaction records in a text file and generate a variety of reports from them. It also provides a web interface so you can freeze your transactions and send them to your accountant.

It's in a style that is similar to Ledger. If neither of these sound familiar, you may want to check out the [reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/) or the [plaintextaccounting website](https://plaintextaccounting.org/).

[Fava](https://fava.pythonanywhere.com/example-beancount-file/income_statement/) is a web interface for beancount making it easier to visualize your finance. The best part is that fava and beancount are both written in Python and therefore easily extended to fit my needs.

## The Journey to Beancount

### Spreadsheet

I started off like most persons with a Google sheet or Excel generated template that has no marcos to automate the process of clearing the sheet monthly and recording that data elsewhere. I've tried creating my own spreadsheet which was great and taught me some formulas and VBA, but tedious. I've also tried using several free and paid templates that I found online. My favourites were:

#### CSsanity's [Budget Template](https://www.cassanity.com/budget-template/)

I had the paid version that I will refer from time to time for my long-term investments.

#### [Budget Template](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/budget-template.html) from Vertex42.

I used this for a while and it was great, but I found it not very flexible for my needs and hard to customise.

#### [Aspire Budgeting](https://aspirebudget.com/)

This is a google spreadsheet that I came across because of its [reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/). This community has Andriod and iOS apps to make data entry a little easier, however, the voluntary developer who made these apps took a step back recently so [the iOS app may not be available anymore](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/comments/v78yir/time_to_say_goodbye/). At the time that I used it, someone had posted an app script to create recurring transactions. It appears that creator of Aspire budget has added it to the [G suite add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/aspire_budgeting/591997494881) that extends the functionality of the sheet. It is great for people on a tight budget who know all of their incoming expenses can just automate those expenses so they don't have to keep entering the same things repeatedly.

Once I crossed all those bridges, I realised I just hated entering data into a spreadsheet.

### Apps

#### Mint

[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is a free personal finance management service that connects to your bank accounts and credit cards to help you track your spending and budget. It is available for [Web](https://www.mint.com/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mint-personal-finance-money/id300238550) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mint&hl=en_US).

I thought this was going to be amazing until I remembered that I do not have a bank that can connect with this. One of my banks have a native tool now that's almost like this. It's called CIBC 1stInsights and it's available for [Web](https://www.cibc.com/en/personal-banking/1stinsights.html), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cibc-1stinsights/id1450000000) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cibc.cibc1stinsights&hl=en_CA&gl=US). It's not as good as Mint, but it's better than nothing. Also, it's not free, but it's close. This sets up back like $2 every quarter.

#### MoneyLover

[Moneylover](https://moneylover.me/), made by Vietnamese company Finsify Co Ltd, is available for [Web](https://web.moneylover.me/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id486312413) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookmark.money) is the first app I ever bought. The cute visuals and the ability to connect to my Paypal account to automate my expense handling is what drew me in its web.

Unfortunately, I do not remember why I stopped using it. It seems pretty solid in my re-checking of the tool for this article.

#### Homebank

[Homebank](http://homebank.free.fr/en/) is a free and open-source personal accounting software that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Haiku, AROS, MorphOS and AmigaOS. It is written in C and uses GTK+ for its graphical user interface. It is available in 40 languages.

#### MoneyDance

[MoneyDance](https://infinitekind.com/moneydance) is a personal finance app for Mac, Windows, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android. It is a desktop app that syncs with your mobile devices. It is available in 20 languages.

## Techniques

### The 50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that allocates 50% of after-tax income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or paying off debt. It is a simple way to budget your money and keep your spending in check.

Let me start by saying that my taxed income is 25% of what I earn over JMD$125,000/month or ~US$800/month.

I think we all know that keeping expenses down so we can save is a good idea. Let's see it in practice:

Lets say on a good month, I make US$3,500 or ~JMD$ 535,000 (I wish) and my after-tax income is ~US$2,960. I would allocate 50% of my taxed income to needs, 30% to wants and 20% to savings or paying off debt.

In reality, my monthly cut is more 70% Needs, 5% Wants and 25% unexpected Expenses. In 2022, every single month brought some major unexpected expenses and it still continues. The past 6 months alone have seen me with multiple healthcare expenses, a car accident that put my car away for 3 months and the regular daily things breaking and needing to be replaced. I'm not complaining because I could afford to cover the expenses instead of taking on debt, but I'm just saying that I'm not in a position to save as much or alter my expense ratio.

The advice is normally to get a 3-6 month emergency fund before you start investing. If I don't put my cents away for the future then it will never be a good time to invest. My emergency fund is my chequing account and it gets drained almost as soon as it is funded.

I can see that this may be good advice for those who can act on it and I do try to resist the urge to spend more on Amazon packages that I think will make my life easier that I never end up using. I'm not a big spender, but I do like to have a few things that make my life easier. I'm not a minimalist, but I'm not a hoarder either. I'm somewhere in the middle.

### Budgeting

Budgeting when you blow your budget every single month is painful. I have never found a budget to be useful. I only input budget caps to give me an idea on what my sinking funds (big future expenses that you have to save for) look like for a period of time.

A more useful approach to your finances is to **keep track of the expenses for the month ahead & your sinking funds so you have an idea of your wiggle room for your important variable expenses** like groceries, gas and the expenses that pop up along the way.
