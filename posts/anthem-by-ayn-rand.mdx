## A collection of quotes I liked

“My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose."

"Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish . I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars.”

“We wish to be damned with you, rather than blessed with all our brothers. ”

 “I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man’s soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet.”

  “Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger in solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that there is joy as a bond between us. Give us your hand. Look ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange unknown world, but our own.’ Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.”

  “I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honour is a thing to be earned.”

  ## Summary

  The protagonist of the story, Equality 7-2521, is a man who yearns for [[personal freedom]] in a society where the concept of "I" does not exist, and the word "we" is used in its place. People in this society are not allowed to pursue personal interests or individual aspirations. They are assigned their life roles by the state and are expected to work for the collective good.

Equality 7-2521, however, is different. He possesses a curiosity that leads him to discover a tunnel from the 'Unmentionable Times' (a term referring to the past, pre-collectivist society) where he conducts secret scientific experiments, demonstrating his innovative and independent nature. In his explorations, he rediscovers electric light, something unknown in his society.

Eventually, he falls in love with a woman, Liberty 5-3000, a forbidden act in this society, as relationships and love are also controlled by the state. Both of them escape from the city to live in the Uncharted Forest, a place considered dangerous and forbidden.

While living in the forest, Equality 7-2521 stumbles upon a house from the Unmentionable Times, filled with books from the past. Through these, he learns about individualism and the concept of "I". This knowledge solidifies his belief in the importance of individuality and personal freedom.

He renames himself "[[Prometheus]]" and Liberty 5-3000 as "[[Gaea]]" after the ancient Greek gods, representing the light-bringer and the mother of earth, respectively. Prometheus vows to build a society based on individual freedom, pledging to rescue others who share his belief in individualism.

"Anthem" is a philosophical exploration of Ayn Rand's belief in the importance of individualism over [[collectivism]], asserting the inherent worth and potential of the individual. It's a powerful commentary on freedom, identity, and human aspiration.

## My Thoughts

I listened to this as an audiobook on Youtube. I find satire cringe-worthy although there are some works that I enjoy. However, in this particular work, the portrayal of individualism was a bit overwhelming for my taste. I think it's important to have a balance between individualism and collectivism. While reading this book, it prompted me to reflect on instances where I may have inadvertently prioritized my own individualism at the expense of others. I think it's important to be aware of this and to be mindful of the impact of our actions on others. I believe it is a dangerous mindset to think that we owe nothing to our fellow humans.
