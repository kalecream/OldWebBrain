I missed out on logging for January so I will just start where I am now. I decided to make this one article that will updated weekly with my progress instead of creating several monthly articles.

### Week 2 | Feb 2 - 11


#### Goals

-  Website Responsive Fixes
    - I set up a professional workflow for how to approach the continued development of my personal website, but I've been immersed in work and learning, so I didn't get much done on my website this week besides this goal.

#### Extra 

- Gave [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) a whirl. I already know how to align content in CSS, but sometimes a particular element can make you feel dumb so I wanted the refresh.
    - This was a nice refresher on an option that I forgot about:        `align-content` determines the spacing between lines, while `align-items` determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container. When there is only one line, `align-content` has no effect.
- YouTube lessons
    - [Making acrylic paintings look like oil paintings](https://youtu.be/p1Uk6mwaW1k).
    - [How to deal with acrylic paint transparency](https://youtu.be/Y232GqCx1HY).
- Media of the week | [Murder Mystery (2019)](https://letterboxd.com/film/murder-mystery/)
    - I wasn't expecting much out of it with the 2.7/5 rating, but it was so fun &  the dynamic between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston was great! I got the feel good vibes that I've been needing.
- Tried out engraving/woodcarving with my new rotary tool. I'm making a pattern on the wooden top for my glass teaptot.
- Someone made a [great looking spending tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yGnvbyTi0NF-rmNlsMD1ccFmzAR9_uxFXEsvhTpcieg/edit#gid=1876826370) on [/r/PFTools](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFtools/comments/10w74tq/i_made_a_spending_tracker_for_myself_and_wanted/)
